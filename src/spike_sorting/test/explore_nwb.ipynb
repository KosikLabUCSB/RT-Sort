Ten rats were used for chronic electrophysiological recordings paired with glucose  monitoring. Eight rats were used for optogenetic induction of SPW-Rs and glucose monitoring. Six rats were used for  the DREADD experiment, and seven rats were used as controls for this experiment. Three additional rats were used  for simultaneous dorsal and ventral hippocampus recordings. Six additional rats were used for the posterior  parietal cortex (PPC) optogenetic stimulation control experiments. Sample sizes were selected to match cohort  sizes where applicable.\n",
